# Backend Development Sprint Plan

This document outlines the sprint plan for developing the NestJS backend for the Sofa Deal E-Commerce platform. Authentication will be handled by the frontend directly with Supabase Auth, so it's excluded from the backend sprint planning.

## Overview

The backend development will follow a 4-sprint cycle, with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. The focus will be on implementing the core e-commerce functionality in a modular, scalable manner using NestJS and TypeScript.

## Sprint 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

   - Initialize NestJS project with TypeScript
   - Configure project structure following NestJS best practices
   - Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Jest for code quality and testing
   - Configure database connection with Supabase PostgreSQL
   - Set up logging and error handling

2. **Database Access Layer** (2 days)
   - Implement database services/repositories for interacting with Supabase
   - Create base models/DTOs for all entities
   - Set up validation pipes and error handling

3. **Categories Module** (2 days)
   - Implement CRUD operations for categories
   - Support hierarchical category structure
   - Add endpoints for listing categories with optional nesting
   - Implement filtering and pagination

4. **Products Module** (4 days)
   - Implement CRUD operations for products
   - Create product variants handling
   - Implement product image management
   - Set up search endpoints with FTS and trigram support
   - Add filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities
   - Implement product listing by category

### Deliverables:
- Functional NestJS application with proper structure
- Database connection and models
- Categories and Products modules with complete API endpoints
- Unit tests for implemented functionality

## Sprint 2: Shopping Cart, Inventory, and Discounts (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal:** Implement shopping cart functionality, inventory management, and discount system.

### Tasks:

1. **Product Variants and Inventory Management** (3 days)
   - Implement stock tracking for product variants
   - Add inventory update logic
   - Create bulk operations for inventory management
   - Add low stock notifications or webhooks

2. **Shopping Cart Module** (4 days)
   - Implement cart creation and management
   - Support both guest carts (session-based) and user carts
   - Create endpoints for adding, updating, removing cart items
   - Implement cart merging (guest cart â†’ user cart)
   - Add validation for stock availability

3. **Discount System** (3 days)
   - Implement discount definitions (percent/fixed, dates)
   - Create logic for applying discounts to categories/products/variants
   - Add endpoints for calculating applicable discounts
   - Implement discount validation (date ranges, eligibility)

### Deliverables:
- Complete inventory management system
- Fully functional shopping cart API
- Discount system with application logic
- Unit and integration tests for new functionality

## Sprint 3: Orders, Checkout, and Payment Integration (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal:** Implement order processing, checkout flow, and integrate payment providers.

### Tasks:

1. **Orders Module** (3 days)
   - Implement order creation from cart
   - Create order status management
   - Add order history endpoints
   - Implement order item management
   - Create validators for order data

2. **Checkout Process** (3 days)
   - Implement checkout endpoint that handles:
     - Inventory validation
     - Price calculation with discounts
     - Address validation
     - Cart to order conversion
   - Create idempotent checkout process

3. **Payment Integration** (4 days)
   - Implement Stripe payment integration
   - Add PayPal payment integration
   - Create webhook handlers for payment events
   - Implement payment status tracking
   - Add transaction recording

### Deliverables:
- Complete order management system
- Functional checkout process
- Payment provider integrations (Stripe and PayPal)
- Webhook handlers for payment status updates
- Unit and integration tests for order and payment functionality

## Sprint 4: Search, Notifications, and System Optimization (Weeks 7-8)

**Goal:** Enhance search capabilities, implement notification systems, and optimize overall performance.

### Tasks:

1. **Advanced Search Implementation** (3 days)
   - Optimize PostgreSQL full-text search
   - Enhance typo-tolerant search with trigram matching
   - Implement faceted search (filtering by attributes)
   - Add search results ranking and relevance sorting
   - Optimize search performance

2. **Notification System** (3 days)
   - Implement email notification service
   - Add WhatsApp Business API integration
   - Create notification templates for:
     - Order confirmation
     - Payment status
     - Shipping updates
     - Delivery confirmation
   - Implement notification preferences

3. **Performance Optimization and System Hardening** (4 days)
   - Implement caching for product catalog and categories
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Implement request validation and sanitization
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Set up monitoring and logging

### Deliverables:
- Enhanced search functionality
- Complete notification system with multiple channels
- Optimized API performance
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Hardened security measures
- Final unit and integration tests

## Dependencies and Considerations

- **Database Schema**: The backend implementation relies on the database schema being set up according to the migrations defined in the `migrations` folder.
- **Frontend Coordination**: While authentication is handled by the frontend, coordination is needed for endpoint expectations and data formats.
- **External Services**: Integration with Stripe, PayPal, email services, and WhatsApp Business API requires accounts and credentials set up.
- **Testing**: Each sprint includes time for unit and integration testing to ensure functionality works as expected.

## API Documentation Strategy

Throughout the sprints, we will document the API using:
- NestJS Swagger integration for interactive API documentation
- Markdown documentation in `/docs/api` folder describing each endpoint
- Example requests and responses

## Monitoring and Deployment

- Set up logging with Winston or similar
- Configure error tracking
- Prepare for deployment using Docker
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

This sprint plan provides a structured approach to building the e-commerce backend over 8 weeks, focusing on delivering key functionality incrementally while ensuring quality and robustness.
