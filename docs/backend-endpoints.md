## Implementation Notes

- All endpoints should support appropriate HTTP status codes
- Error responses should follow a consistent format
- Admin endpoints should be protected by role-based access control
- Public endpoints with session should validate session token or cookie
- All list endpoints should support pagination
- Search and filter endpoints should support sorting
- Consider implementing rate limiting for public endpoints
- Ensure idempotency for payment and order operations
- Use proper validation for all input data
- Consider adding versioning to the API (e.g., `/v1/products`)

This endpoint list provides a comprehensive foundation for the e-commerce backend. Additional endpoints may be needed depending on specific business requirements or as the application evolves.
