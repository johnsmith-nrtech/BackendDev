# 🚀 Upload System Updates - Direct File Upload to Supabase

## What Changed

The upload system has been updated to use **direct file uploads** to Supabase storage through your API, instead of using pre-existing URLs.

## 🔄 Before vs After

### Before (URL Method):
```javascript
// Used pre-existing URLs
const imageUrl = `${CONFIG.IMAGE_BASE_URL}TURKISH SOFAS/Verona Turkish Sofa Bed/image.webp`;

await axios.post(`/products/${productId}/images`, {
  url: imageUrl,
  type: 'main',
  order: 1
});
```

### After (File Upload Method):
```javascript
// Uploads actual files from local filesystem
const imagePath = path.join(CONFIG.IMAGES_BASE_PATH, 'TURKISH SOFAS', 'Verona Turkish Sofa Bed', 'image.webp');

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('imageFile', fs.createReadStream(imagePath));
formData.append('type', 'main');
formData.append('order', '1');

await axios.post(`/products/${productId}/images`, formData);
```

## ✅ Benefits of New System

### 🎯 Automatic Supabase Upload
- Files are automatically uploaded to your Supabase storage
- Your API handles all the Supabase integration
- No need to manually configure storage URLs

### 🔒 Secure & Reliable
- Files are uploaded directly through your authenticated API
- No dependency on external URLs or CDNs
- Better error handling and file validation

### 📁 Local File Processing
- Reads files directly from your `docs/myairbridge-AW2acMVeeJI/` folder
- Verifies file existence before upload
- Shows file sizes and upload progress

### 🏗️ API Integration
- Uses your existing `/products/admin/products/:id/images` endpoint
- Supports multipart form-data as documented in your API
- Returns actual Supabase URLs after successful upload

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Dependencies Added:
```json
{
  "form-data": "^4.0.0"  // For multipart form uploads
}
```

### File Structure Changes:
```javascript
// Old configuration
CONFIG: {
  IMAGE_BASE_URL: 'https://your-supabase.co/...',  // ❌ Removed
  IMAGES_BASE_PATH: './docs/myairbridge-AW2acMVeeJI'  // ✅ Still used
}

// New configuration  
CONFIG: {
  IMAGES_BASE_PATH: './docs/myairbridge-AW2acMVeeJI'  // ✅ Only path needed
}
```

### Upload Function Changes:
```javascript
// New upload function signature
async function uploadProductImage(productId, imagePath, type, order) {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('imageFile', fs.createReadStream(imagePath));
  formData.append('type', type);
  formData.append('order', order.toString());
  
  return await axios.post(`/products/${productId}/images`, formData, {
    headers: formData.getHeaders()
  });
}
```

## 📊 What Happens During Upload

1. **File Discovery**: Script scans MyAirBridge folders for image files
2. **File Validation**: Checks if each image file exists and is readable
3. **Form Creation**: Creates multipart form with image file + metadata
4. **API Upload**: Sends to your `/products/:id/images` endpoint
5. **Supabase Storage**: Your API automatically uploads to Supabase
6. **URL Return**: API returns the final Supabase storage URL
7. **Database Storage**: Image record saved with Supabase URL

## 🎯 Example Upload Flow

```
Local File: docs/myairbridge-AW2acMVeeJI/TURKISH SOFAS/Verona Turkish Sofa Bed/image.webp
     ↓
API Upload: POST /products/123/images (multipart form-data)
     ↓  
Supabase: Your API uploads to storage bucket
     ↓
Final URL: https://xyz.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/product-images/abc123.webp
     ↓
Database: Image record stored with final URL
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

The setup is now even simpler:

1. **Install**: `npm install` (includes new form-data dependency)
2. **Test**: `npm run test-upload` (verifies file upload works)
3. **Upload**: `npm run upload` (uploads all 118+ images)

## 🔍 Verification

After upload, you can verify:
- **Database**: Check your `product_images` table for new records
- **Supabase**: Check your storage bucket for uploaded files
- **API**: Test image URLs in browser to confirm accessibility

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Image file not found"**
- Check that `docs/myairbridge-AW2acMVeeJI/` folder exists
- Verify folder structure matches expected layout

**"Failed to upload image"**
- Check your API logs for Supabase storage errors
- Verify Supabase storage bucket permissions
- Ensure storage bucket exists and is configured

**"Form data headers missing"**
- Ensure `form-data` dependency is installed
- Check that `formData.getHeaders()` is included in request
